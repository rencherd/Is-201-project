                        <p>I’ve always believed that hands-on experiences are one of the best ways to learn. Whether it’s through building, fixing, or performing, I’ve been able to explore my passions in various fields that not only challenge my skills but allow me to continually improve and grow.</p>
                        <p>Over the years, I’ve developed a diverse set of skills—from crafting furniture to restoring vintage cars. These experiences have taught me problem-solving, creativity, and a deep appreciation for craftsmanship. Here’s a closer look at some of the most exciting and rewarding projects I’ve worked on:</p>
                        <p>Whether it’s woodworking, mechanics, or dance, I’ve always sought to push myself beyond the ordinary. Each of these areas has given me the opportunity to learn and apply different techniques, all while working on projects I’m truly passionate about.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Woodworking</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>Building functional and beautiful pieces:</em> I built my parents’ dining room table, combining reclaimed wood with epoxy to create a durable, one-of-a-kind piece that became a centerpiece of their home.</li>
                                    <li><em>Designing custom furniture:</em> I crafted a rustic, farmhouse-style bed frame for our guest bedroom, carefully selecting the materials and finishes to give it a timeless appeal. <a href="Webapp/Table.html" style="color: #007bff;">Build a Table Game</a></li>
                                    <li><em>Innovating with new techniques:</em> I recently experimented with live-edge wood to create a series of shelves for my office, embracing natural imperfections to enhance their beauty.</li>

                                    <li><em>Hands-on automotive repairs:</em> Over the past 10 years, I’ve worked on cars, learning everything from basic maintenance to more advanced repairs. I take pride in troubleshooting and bringing vehicles back to life.</li>
                                    <li><em>Engine rebuilding:</em> I’ve rebuilt several engines, learning intricate mechanical details and developing a strong understanding of how each component works together to power the vehicle.</li>
                                    <li><em>Restoring vintage vehicles:</em> One of my proudest achievements was restoring a <a href="truck.html" style="color: #007bff;">1954 Ford F100 truck</a>, a project that required patience, attention to detail, and a deep appreciation for classic American engineering.</li>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>Passion for movement:</em> I’ve been practicing ballroom dance since I was in 5th grade, and it’s become a lifelong passion that keeps me grounded and disciplined.</li>
                                    <li><em>Team leadership and collaboration:</em> Throughout high school, I was part of a competitive ballroom dance team. I became the team captain my senior year, leading by example and helping to improve our performances.</li>
                                    <li><em>Performing and competing:</em> As a dancer, I’ve participated in multiple competitions, learning the value of both individual performance and teamwork to create beautiful, synchronized routines.</li>
